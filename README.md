# 21_Days_Amogh
Hello! my name is Amogh PrabhuTendulker. 
Lets start the 21 days **Intermediate** challenge!

Day1: I started with Data cleaning. I know the concept so I had to just brush up with the concepts!

Day2: I read Feature Selection Techniques in Machine Learning with Python article along with basic code implementation

Day 3: I watched all the 7 videos on Data science project from stratch. I also tried some of the concepts
I also completed the intro to machine learning course on kaggle

Day 4: I competed intermediate machine learning and pandas on kaggle

Day 5: I watched a couple of videoes on data visualization.I also completed the data visualization course on kaggle

Day 6: I read the Feature Engineering: What Powers Machine Learning by Will Koehrsen

Day 7 : I read Data Science Performance Metrics for Everyone by Andrew Long and K-means Clustering article

Day 8: i Started with advance course in NPL. watched naive bayes video 

Day 9 : i watched KNN Algorithm Using Python | How KNN Algorithm Works | Data Science For Beginners | Simplilearn

Day 10: i tried Naive bayes implementation in python

Day 11:I implemented KNN in python from scratch

Day 12:Implemented locally weighted regression for KNN and KNN for continuous values

Day 13: Implementation of Naive bayes for text classification

Day 14: i read the logistic regression pdf

Day 15: i read a beginner's guide to sentiment analysis

day 16: i started with linear regression videos

day 17: i started with CNN

Day 18: i didn't get much time but I continued with CNN

Day 19: I started watching "A friendly introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Recognition"

Day 20: i tried to implement CNN in python and also started reading on LSTMs

Day 21: i tried to implement LSTMs in python but couldnt update the status on github as i had a very bad nw yerterday

project: bigmart sales using linearregressiona and randomforestregression
